Description:
This exercise was to practice inheritage. The father's class was a general fractal where
the sub-classes were the different fractals, holding the size of it's grid. The fractal holds the
degree of the shape.

Implementation:
After determining the inheritance tree, I had to stand the rule of five, most of it by default
functions.
Parsing the file is by reading it line by line and analyzing the numbers. If an error had occurred,
the program would get rid of the allocated memory and exit with code 1. If the file was correct
it would print the fractals in a reversed order, that is why I used a vector so I could read it
the other way around in the printing process.
I created a factory which would determine by the given type which fractal should be returned,
or nullptr if no memory was allocated, so that the main would know of the failure.
Also a function for getting rid of the vector was created to use it in several places.
